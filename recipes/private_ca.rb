# INSTALL PRIVATE CAs into the OpenSSL Framework

# node.openssl.private_CAs is expected to be a list of CA certs
# that are already placed within node.openssl.ca_dir
# this recipe will get the openssl hash for each and create a symbolic link
# to the cert such that openssl will add it to the chain

# manual instructions which this recipe replicates
# http://gagravarr.org/writing/openssl-certs/others.shtml
